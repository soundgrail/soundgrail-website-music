If Excision and Illenium together on a single track doesn't get you excited then not much else in this world will either. 'Gold' has been teased since last April and it is finally upon us, and oh does it sound amazing. This record features soothing synths and dreamy vocals from Shallows. This is as good as it gets. Check it out if you haven't yet!
