Tracks like Sharked's 'Saturn', fresh from Future Bass XO Records, truly show us how the bounds of future bass music can be pushed. This vibey tune gives you exactly what you want to hear with a catchy vocal chop intro and a motivating build into a captivating and equally interesting drop.

This tune has an incredible production style that resonates with the listener in ways that most music simply cannot. We are incredibly excited to hear more from this new artist.
