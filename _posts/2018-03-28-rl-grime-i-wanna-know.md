The Los Angeles producer whips up a new banger earlier this with Daya called 'I wanna Know' and it's absolutely beautiful in every way.

For most RL fans, it's pretty clear that this record explores some new territory that we weren't exactly expecting.

However, it steers us in a positive direction and we can't wait for more. This heartfelt track definitely presents a healthy opportunity to grow for RL Grime. It's the first single off RL Grime's new Album _Nova_ coming out later this year!
