French-born Electro House DJ and music producer, Bassive, is one of the leading Electro House names in the Middle-East, where he is based.

He has had several top-100 and featured releases on BeatPort under some of the biggest labels in the industry, including Big Fish Recordings, Big Alliance, and Into The AM Records, not forgetting the highly acclaimed artists who have shown support for his work, like Designer Drugs, Far Too Loud, and Lazy Rich, just to name a few. Last year, Bassive launched his own record label, Bad Family Recordings, which has seen releases on BeatPort’s top 10, and has quickly established itself as a well respected label in the scene.

Bassive has been working on a new EP in the last few months which SoundGrail can exclusive announce will be released 18 June. With catchy Electro House melodies, dirty Electro drops and even some Dubstep thrown in, this EP is sure to be a must-have upon release! Bassive is performing several shows in Canada this summer.

{% include /app/helpers/blog-blockquote.html quote="I’ve been working on this EP on and off the road between Dubai and Paris, taking some time for each track and being open to new styles of production by not really paying atention to any specific genre. ‘Bassface’ is the reinterpretation of those 2-3 seconds before the drop where you put your “Bassface” on. ‘Going To California’ and ‘Bassface’ are the new versions of some stuff that I made in early 2011 that was never released so I decided to recycle them." author="Bassive" %}
