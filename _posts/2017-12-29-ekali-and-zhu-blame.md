ZHU and Ekali have teamed up to release a free download on OWSLA called "Blame." The shadowy electronic cut features ZHU's smooth falsetto vocals and Ekali's trendsetting sound design.

Both Ekali and Zhu have made some power moves in 2017 but that doesn't mean he's all out for this year. Just as we thought we wouldn't hear anything until 2018, these two powerful producers came in clutch on the last few days of December with a trend-setting collaboration on a track they call "Blame".

Sending us into 2018, these two artists know how to please their fans with fat chord, big stabs, and of course the leading arpeggios. The production on this track is pure genius and it's bound to get you off your feet and dancing like there's no tomorrow.

Ekali and Zhu open up "Blame" with a catchy vocal that grabs your attention from the start. With a brief pause to draw a sense of excitement, they come back in again for a powerful build into a ground-shaking drop with flutters of plucks and filling bass.

Listen to it today! What are you waiting for!
