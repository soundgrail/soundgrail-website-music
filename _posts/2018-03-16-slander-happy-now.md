SLANDER has been known for creating a wide variety from their pioneered genre heaven trap all the way to bass-heavy trap.

In this latest release "Happy Now", however, the show a small glimpse of their emotional side and take us on a journey back to the genre that made them who they are today. This heaven trap, future bass hybrid is out now on Monstercat records. SLANDER truly captures a nostalgic feeling with driving bass lines, lush chords, trickling melodies and perfectly complementary vocals.

Even those longing for a crispy bass drop will still feel something from this lush, emotional track by this ever so successful duo. If anything, this track just goes to show how their experimentation can lead to a blending of many different genres.
