KIRUE is easily becoming one of the hottest electronic producers in the scene at the moment. Releasing single after single of pure amazing future music, KIRUE keeps the ball rolling with his new banger remix of Flux Pavilions "Pull the Trigger" featuring ominous atmosphere and expressive vocals.

KIRUE's unique ability to fill a song with emotion is an art untapped by most other producers. Coming out along with this track is an equally awesome music video that we highly recommend checking out. Be on the lookout for more pieces from this brilliant mind coming soon!
