If you thought he was done after his new album, think again! What So Not follows the 12 song, full-lengthed album with a long-awaited spot on Diplo and Friends. What So Not put together an hour long set of pure beauty with both his music and the music of other great electronic artists.

Naturally, he worked some of the tracks from his Not All the Beautiful Things into the mix including "Warlord" with SLUMBERJACK and "Beautiful". Other What So Not classics such as "Touched" and "Jaguar" also make an appearance.

Overall this mix is just crafter to perfection. What So Not truly spent the time to mix each song brilliantly by creating a vibe that is truly difficult to replicate. It's great to hear how everything works together in this set.
