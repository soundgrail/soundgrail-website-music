Diplo, the king of dance music, has released his long-awaited EP 'California' and we couldn't be more excited for this ground-breaking advance in hip-hop and electronic music.

Diplo’s highly anticipated new California EP has pushed the boundaries of genres and these 6 tracks will leave you begging for more. This collection of records includes some of his previously released singles such as 'Get It Right [Remix]” featuring MØ and GoldLink, and a few unreleased tracks including some with collaborations with Trippie Redd, Desiigner, and Lil Xan.

Earlier this week Diplo hosted a release party in Los Angeles. The party featured exclusive clothing, prints and more inspired by California.
