This record begins off with ethereal synths and dreamy vocals and builds into a powerful drop that only Illenium could deliver with such imepccability.

Things intensify and the vocals carry us into a mix of heavy bass and beautiful chops. The force of this track singlehandedly encompasses Illenium's best work. Before we know it, the song is over and all we're left with is a feeling for more. Check this one out if you haven't heard it yet!
