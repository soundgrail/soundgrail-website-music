Tisoki made some power moves in 2017 but that doesn't mean he's all out for this year. 2018 is already off to a great start with his first release of the year on Never Say Die called "Symmetry".

Tisoki knows how to please his fans with that oh so hard bass we all want to hear. The production on this track is pure genius and it's bound to get you off your feet and dancing like there's no tomorrow.

Tisoki opens up with a catchy vocal that grabs your attention from the start. With a brief pause to draw a sense of excitement, he comes back in again for a powerful build into a ground-shaking drop of plucks, bass, lasers, and thick drums.
