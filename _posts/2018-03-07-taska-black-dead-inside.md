Taska Black is easily becoming one of the hottest electronic producers in the scene at the moment. Signed to San Holo's progressive future label Bitbird, Taska keeps the ball rolling with his new banger "Dead Inside" featuring ominous atmosphere and expressive vocals.

Taska Black's unique ability to fill a song with emotion is an art untapped by most other producers. Coming out along with this track is an equally awesome music video that we highly recommend checking out. Be on the lookout for more pieces from this brilliant mind coming soon!
