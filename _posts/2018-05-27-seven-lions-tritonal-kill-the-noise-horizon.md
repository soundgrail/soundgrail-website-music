'Horizon' is the latest brainchild of 3 top-tier artists Seven Lions, Tritonal, and Kill the Noise. This record begins off with ethereal synths and dreamy vocals by Haliene.

Things intensify and the vocals carry us into a flurry of heavy bass, paradoxical synths and beautiful chops. The force of this track singlehandedly encompasses the three unique styles of these amazing producers: Tritonal's unforgettable chords, Seven Lion's ambient soundscapes, and Kill the Noise's powerful bass design.

They absolutely nail this combination making for an unforgettable record.
