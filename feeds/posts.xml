        <p>This record begins off with ethereal synths and dreamy vocals and builds into a powerful drop that only Illenium could deliver with such imepccability.</p>

<p>Things intensify and the vocals carry us into a mix of heavy bass and beautiful chops. The force of this track singlehandedly encompasses Illenium’s best work. Before we know it, the song is over and all we’re left with is a feeling for more. Check this one out if you haven’t heard it yet!</p>

        <p>Ekali and Slumberjack, two of our personal favorites, have just released their warm and filthy track ‘Helios’. This record features a heart-warming into that soon transitions into a slapping drop that eventually takes us right back to the vibes again. If anything, this track is a great combination of both of these prominent artists’ styles. Give it a listen if you haven’t already.</p>

        <p>‘Horizon’ is the latest brainchild of 3 top-tier artists Seven Lions, Tritonal, and Kill the Noise. This record begins off with ethereal synths and dreamy vocals by Haliene.</p>

<p>Things intensify and the vocals carry us into a flurry of heavy bass, paradoxical synths and beautiful chops. The force of this track singlehandedly encompasses the three unique styles of these amazing producers: Tritonal’s unforgettable chords, Seven Lion’s ambient soundscapes, and Kill the Noise’s powerful bass design.</p>

        <p>The Los Angeles producer whips up a new banger earlier this with Daya called ‘I wanna Know’ and it’s absolutely beautiful in every way.</p>

<p>For most RL fans, it’s pretty clear that this record explores some new territory that we weren’t exactly expecting.</p>

<p>However, it steers us in a positive direction and we can’t wait for more. This heartfelt track definitely presents a healthy opportunity to grow for RL Grime. It’s the first single off RL Grime’s new Album <em>Nova</em> coming out later this year!</p>

<p>Check out the awesome lyric video for RL Grime &amp; Daya’s ‘I Wanna Know’</p>

        <p>1788-L &amp; 4AM are absolutely killing it in the electronic scene right now.</p>

<p>1788-L is bass music’s biggest breakout star in 2018 and they still have a ton of wiggle room. He’s already dropped some great bass-heavy remixes of Virtual Self and Daft Punk.</p>

<p>This new collaboration with 4AM is another wonderful additional to his repertoire of bass music hits. This guy is also pumps out new tunes like there’s no tomorrow. Not even 2 weeks ago 1788-L had under 1,000 followers and only a few tracks. Now he has 5 tracks, 5,000 followers, and got reposted from huge artist like the chainsmokers! And all of his music is top-shelf kind of stuff. We’re talking Mr. Carmack 3 years ago type level of releases.</p>

<p>We can’t wait to see what the rest of the future holds for this budding talent. Until then check out “Multiverse” and see what all the hype is about.</p>

        <p>Tisoki made some power moves in 2017 but that doesn’t mean he’s all out for this year. 2018 is already off to a great start with his first release of the year on Never Say Die called “Symmetry”.</p>

<p>Tisoki knows how to please his fans with that oh so hard bass we all want to hear. The production on this track is pure genius and it’s bound to get you off your feet and dancing like there’s no tomorrow.</p>

<p>Tisoki opens up with a catchy vocal that grabs your attention from the start. With a brief pause to draw a sense of excitement, he comes back in again for a powerful build into a ground-shaking drop of plucks, bass, lasers, and thick drums.</p>

        <p>If you thought he was done after his new album, think again! What So Not follows the 12 song, full-lengthed album with a long-awaited spot on Diplo and Friends. What So Not put together an hour long set of pure beauty with both his music and the music of other great electronic artists.</p>

<p>Naturally, he worked some of the tracks from his Not All the Beautiful Things into the mix including “Warlord” with SLUMBERJACK and “Beautiful”. Other What So Not classics such as “Touched” and “Jaguar” also make an appearance.</p>

<p>Overall this mix is just crafter to perfection. What So Not truly spent the time to mix each song brilliantly by creating a vibe that is truly difficult to replicate. It’s great to hear how everything works together in this set.</p>

        <p>Boombox Cartel are back again with another room shaking trap banger. Their previous single “Whisper” took us by surprise with a unique blend of hard hitting synths and lush organic guitars.</p>

<p>But “Moon Love” acts as a dirty followup with a rap verse featuring Nessly and a slamming drop that’s exactly what you would expect from this dominating duo. This is the ID we’ve all heard countless times before in every bass artists’ set in the last few months.</p>

<p>Finally, it has surfaced and it’s a release you don’t want to miss. The energy in the drop truly creates a monster of a record. If anything, this is just another great showcase of Boombox’s diverse and evolving style. Records like this definitely deserve the upmost respect and praise and we highly recommend that you go check it out!</p>

        <p>Australian act What So Not has released his debut album ‘Not All the Beautiful Things’ and it is, no pun intended, absolutely beautiful. It’s filled to the brim with record after record of quality collaborations, vocal features, and dirty bass lines compassing the original, yet evolved What So Not sound.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, he is one of the leading electronic acts out of Australia with remixes and hits like ‘High You Are’, ‘Tell Me’, and more but he has yet to release a full-length debut album. That’s what makes this album extra special.</p>

<p>While his 2017 release schedule was sparse, there were some single gems such as “Better” featuring LPX. But it’s clear that he was spending most of his time crafting this full-length, 12 track album exploring various styles and massive collaborations. In fact, the album featured collaborations with artists Skrillex, Slumberjack, San Holo, and American rock band Toto.</p>

<p>Check out his amazing work of art today!</p>

        <p>Taska Black is easily becoming one of the hottest electronic producers in the scene at the moment. Signed to San Holo’s progressive future label Bitbird, Taska keeps the ball rolling with his new banger “Dead Inside” featuring ominous atmosphere and expressive vocals.</p>

<p>Taska Black’s unique ability to fill a song with emotion is an art untapped by most other producers. Coming out along with this track is an equally awesome music video that we highly recommend checking out. Be on the lookout for more pieces from this brilliant mind coming soon!</p>

        <p>Tracks like Sharked’s ‘Saturn’, fresh from Future Bass XO Records, truly show us how the bounds of future bass music can be pushed. This vibey tune gives you exactly what you want to hear with a catchy vocal chop intro and a motivating build into a captivating and equally interesting drop.</p>

<p>This tune has an incredible production style that resonates with the listener in ways that most music simply cannot. We are incredibly excited to hear more from this new artist.</p>

        <p><em>Firstly, what made you decide to follow a career as a DJ and producer?</em>
I had always been into music since I was a kid.  Growing up I played classical piano, and in grade school, I jammed around with friends a lot, but it wasn’t until I got to college that I really began to fall in love with dance music.  While in school, I downloaded Ableton and just messed around trying to make electronic music for fun as a hobby.  After putting out a few remixes online for free the project started to gain traction and that was when I decided I could maybe do this for a career.</p>

<p><em>Growing up, who were your musical inspirations?</em>
I had a lost of different inspirations when I was a kid.  My favorite band was Muse, but I was also super into classic music, especially the “darker” stuff like Bach. I also listened to a lot of pop music growing up too.  As far as dance music producers go I would say Skrillex and What So Not were some of the names that really wow’ed me when I first got into the music.</p>

<!--3. Your new single ‘Feel Good’ features Illenium and Daya. How did this collaboration come about?
I first got this demo from Daya last Fall, and it immediately resonated with the vocal and what she was speaking about lyrically. I was finishing up my tour and had a day off in Denver and decided to meet up with my friend Illenium.  We started working on the track at his studio and then finished it by passing the song back and forth between LA and Denver over the next month. I re-wrote the bridge and additional verses with Daya and Toby Gad back in LA around that time as well.-->

<!-- _The track is giving us plenty of summer vibes, what was the inspiration behind the song?_
I think the primary inspiration was to create a song that was filled with love and heart.  I don’t necessarily mean a relationship/intimate kind of love. Just the idea of a relationship making someone feel better and picking them up when they need it, and just being there for someone. With that in mind, I wanted the production to reflect that sort of beauty but in an intense, euphoric type of way. -->

<p><em>You are going to be graduating college in a few months, how will things change for you?</em>
I spent a lot of my time in college producing music and I’ll only have more time after graduating so I am excited to keep things moving!</p>

<p><em>You have also worked with Bipolar Sunshine and Josef Salvat in the past. Are there any other artists you would like to collaborate with?</em>
There are so many artists I’d love to collaborate with. What So Not, Illenium, and Ekali are a few I’d love to collaborate with someday.</p>

<p><em>We know you play piano and guitar. Are there any other instruments you would like to learn?</em>
I would love to be able to play brass.  That would be super cool because it’s so fundamentally different from a piano and guitar. I’d love to be a drummer too.</p>

<p><em>You’ve remixed songs for artists including Years and Years and Tove Lo in the past. If you could choose three songs to remix right now, what would they be?</em>
Wow good question. That’s a tough one but I would always be down to do an official remix for Skrillex. There’s another song I would say, but I got the opportunity to remix it and it’s coming out soon!</p>

<p><em>What has been the highlight of your career so far?</em>
There have been several highlights over the past year or so. The first shows in 2016 were really big for me. Anytime I release a new single it feels like a highlight for me. Coachella coming up is a big one.</p>

<p><em>Can we expect an album from you anytime soon?</em>
An album is in the works at the moment but I am very particular about my music so expect to see another EP from me first!</p>

<!-- _With summer coming up, what are your favorite songs to get you in the party mood?_
Post Malone’s “Congratulations” is like a summer nights jam. Marshmello’s “Chasing Colors” is a guilty pleasure.  The XX’s “On Hold” has been a favorite of mine for several months. -->

<p><em>Finally, what plans do you have for the rest of 2017?</em>
I’ll be doing a lot of festival shows this summer and going back on a big tour this Fall. I’m looking to put out my EP this summer as well. And hopefully doing some more international touring later this year!</p>

        <p>French-born Electro House DJ and music producer, Bassive, is one of the leading Electro House names in the Middle-East, where he is based.</p>

<p>He has had several top-100 and featured releases on BeatPort under some of the biggest labels in the industry, including Big Fish Recordings, Big Alliance, and Into The AM Records, not forgetting the highly acclaimed artists who have shown support for his work, like Designer Drugs, Far Too Loud, and Lazy Rich, just to name a few. Last year, Bassive launched his own record label, Bad Family Recordings, which has seen releases on BeatPort’s top 10, and has quickly established itself as a well respected label in the scene.</p>

<p>Bassive has been working on a new EP in the last few months which SoundGrail can exclusive announce will be released 18 June. With catchy Electro House melodies, dirty Electro drops and even some Dubstep thrown in, this EP is sure to be a must-have upon release! Bassive is performing several shows in Canada this summer.</p>

<p>I’ve been working on this EP on and off the road between Dubai and Paris, taking some time for each track and being open to new styles of production by not really paying atention to any specific genre. ‘Bassface’ is the reinterpretation of those 2-3 seconds before the drop where you put your “Bassface” on. ‘Going To California’ and ‘Bassface’ are the new versions of some stuff that I made in early 2011 that was never released so I decided to recycle them.</p>

        <p>Love the music</p>

<p>Has there ever been a time when you were listening to an amazing tune that just gave you the chills? Have you ever felt an overwhelming physical sense of well-being and happiness at a live concert when the lights flash, the tempo climbs, and the beat drops?</p>

<p>If you’re not at SoundGrail by some accidental click, we’re willing to bet a hefty sum that you know exactly what we’re talking about. So, like us, you may have thought to yourself something along the lines of, “Damn, this is amazing. I’m so lucky I learned about and love this music. So many other people are missing out so bad.”</p>

<p>Well, if you have thought this, you’re right. Other people are missing out, but it may not really be their fault. The next time you show someone Strobe and they look at you with a “So?” look on their face you can possibly blame their biology, not their horrendous taste in music. (yes, I’m listening to the 10:33 extended mix of Strobe on loop during the writing of this post)</p>

<p>Research done at McGill and Ohio State University have given us greater insight into a phenomenon dubbed “music frisson.” Which has shown that music is in fact capable of stimulating intense dopamine responses in the human brain, but only in a minority of the human population. Yes, thats the same stuff that gets you addicted to, well, just about everything that is addictive. The next time you see the ubiquitous “Music is my Drug” shirt, buy it – its true.</p>

<p>We won’t go into the details as they are quite complex. But they’re a fascinating read if you have any eye for scientific papers. The key takeaway for us is this: we are so lucky. Apparently only 35% of the general population is even able to feel this feeling, and apparently the EDM community heavily overindexes in this population (of course).</p>

<p>So the next time that random person at a party clicks to another song during the buildup of your favorite tune, don’t hate them, pity them.</p>

<p>Our favorite excerpt:</p>

<p>According to Huron, researchers have discovered that several of the frisson’s acoustic…correlates include rapidly large increases in the loudness of music, abrupt changes in tempo and rhythm, a broadening of frequencies and an increase in the number of sound sources, among other factors.  – Our comment: Oh hells yes, it most certainly does.</p>

        <p>This post started as a review on the Axwell concert, but it has evolved into half that, and half a desperate cry for someone to ID this new remix of a song I usually would say should never be remixed, Deadmau5’s gorgeous “Strobe.”  Seriously, this is huge part of why going to live shows is so worth it.  Not only is the atmosphere and party way beyond anything you can do at home, but the chance to hear unreleased and obscure tracks is key.  And this time around, I think we got a gem…</p>

<p>My ears are still ringing as of the writing of this post, and its been almost 24 hours since Axwell left the stage at the Roseland Ballroom this weekend.  I don’t know if its because I’ve gone to too many of these things lately and I’m getting hearing damage (I’m actually legitimately concerned about that, I might have to become one of those people with earplugs I’ve scoffed at in the past) or if its because Axwell probably has the clout to just tell them “to hell with your speakers, and their ears, I’m playing as loud as I want.”  I’m kind of hoping it was the second one just for my health.</p>

<p>Anyways, with this latest concert, the Swedish House Mafia trifecta has been completed in a period of about 4 and half months.  Steve Angello kicked off 2011 at the Roseland Ballroom NYE party, then Sebastian Ingrosso rocked Webster Hall about 2 months ago, and finally we have Axwell to close things off with a bang this weekend.</p>

<p>Axwell came out in full force, playing his classic remixes of “Teenage Crime” as well as “Sweet Disposition” – but also wielding some of the new Swedish fire.  His own new single “Heart is King” was absolutely epic, and of course SHM’s new “Save the World” made an appearance as well.</p>

<p>The highlight for me though?  A new mashup of Deadmau5’s Strobe by Axwell.</p>

<p>Personally, I kind of hero-worship that song.  No matter how irritated I might be with the Mau5 recently, that song is a tribute to the human soul and in the past I’ve disdained attempts to edit it in any way.  You don’t mess with perfection.  However this one, is…I dare say… is very good…   A clean capture of “Save the World” was kind of the point of this trip to NY, but it got released a day before, however this Strobe mashup definitely makes up for it.</p>

<p>Below are some of the highlighted videos from the night, but if you’d like to check them all out please go to our Youtube Channel.  The only tune we are missing is “Heart Is King” – and that’s because the memory card ran out of space halfway through it due to not having deleted last week’s DayGlow videos. It’s a shame since that song was really epic, but oh well, we’ll include it as an MP3 then.</p>

        <h2 id="marlo">MaRLo</h2>
<p>This week we go far away to the land down under, Australia, to bring you one of hottest producers in trance music, MaRLo. MaRLo may be currently based on the sunny island continent, but is originally from what seems like the cradle of electronic music, Holland. This absolutely explosive producer has a long history that has seen him work with Armin van Buuren’s mega label Armada, as well as Spinnin Records and Blackhole recordings.</p>

<p>In fact, Ferry Corsten himself is an avid fan of MaRLo’s work having played MaRLo’s remix of his own “Brain Box” and “Punk” as recently as his set at Ultra this year (MaRLo’s remix of Punk was Ferry’s semi-final track opening for Armin at ASOT500). The quality of his productions frequently brings his work to top the Beatport charts and his original tune “Is it Real” was honored as the tune of the month by EDM publishing stalwarts DJ Magazine, Mixmag, and Tillate.</p>

<p>Although he may be categorized as Trance by Beatport, the simple term seems too constraining to properly describe his artistic style. MaRLo brings some of sharper melodies of techno and overlays them on the classic chords of trance. The results are extraordinarily high energy tracks that are almost equally haunting as they are euphoric. His unique talent in production has taken him beyond the usual tour circuits (yes, that includes Creamfields, Trance Energy, Sensation…. and much more) to perform one-of-a-kind acts such as when he was invited by the Cirque du Soleil to perform an electronic interpretation of their critically acclaimed musical pieces at the massive Uitmarkt festival in Amsterdam.</p>

<p>So straight from Australia, a man who at this very moment has 2 tracks, “Semtex” and “Forward Thinking,” simultaneously riding the Beatport Trance Top 100 for a few weeks now, MaRLo.</p>

<h2 id="interview-with-marlo">Interview with MaRLo</h2>
<p><em>Starting from the beginning, before you entered electronic production, what was your musical background?  How do you believe your roots/interests in other music genre’s influence your musical style today? What is your favorite non-electronic musical style/genre?</em></p>

<p><strong>MaRLo</strong>: I actually started doing computer animation in high school… Then I needed sound effects, sound design and backing tracks for my short animations etc. which kinda lead me on a path of music production. I just love being creative and the idea that first there is nothing and then a few hours later there is something new, original and creative.</p>

<p>I honestly love all sort of different music (cliche answer, I know haha) but I really do love everything from Coldplay to Metallica, some pop stuff, Hip Hop etc…. I really believe that all genres have some gems in there… there is so much good music in all different styles/genres. Diversity is the spice of life.</p>

<p><em>Holland really does seem like the capital of electronic dance music. Its probably the only country to have their national soccer team party with Armin van Buuren after the World Cup. Did your interest in electronic music start at a very young age? What were some of the first sources of music for you? Favorite artists?</em></p>

<p><strong>MaRLo:</strong> I started getting into electronic music when I first heard the early Aphex Twin stuff, and then later The Prodigy absolutely blew me away. Those 2 acts really kicked off my journey into electronic sounds and ideas, then later artists like Mauro Picotto, Ferry Corsten, Armin Van Buuren and Tiesto really excited me.</p>

<p><em>Trance is undoubtedly one of the more “emotional” of the EDM genres. Personally I find the emotion trance evokes to be one of its most important parts. When you make a tune, like “Semtex” or “Forward Thinking” – do you aim for a particular “feel?” If so, how would you describe it? What do you feel works best for your music?</em></p>

<p><strong>MaRLo:</strong> I get influenced by all sorts of stuff, and I don’t really sit down and think “today I’m going to make a tune that sounds kinda like this” or anything, I just start playing around and go with the flow, I let the music and sounds take control and I just kinda go along for the ride as the ideas come to me… it always happens very naturally, and if it doesn’t then I take a break and do something else and get back to it later.</p>

<p><em>How has your experience in tech house and techno affected your style of trance productions? You have an undoubtedly unique sound, how would you characterize the difference between your music and more traditional trance tracks?</em></p>

<p><strong>MaRLo:</strong> I read somewhere that Tiesto is now doing “Trouse”… so I guess I’m kinda doing a new style too… “Trechno” haha</p>

<p>I like all sorts of different music, and there are so many awesome ways of expressing an idea so I try not to stick to a formula or rules of how a certain genre “should” sound… once again though, I just kinda do what feels right for the track at the time and don’t force anything. I guess I am quite influenced by other styles and this also comes accross in my DJ sets where I play a lot of different stuff that I like.  But it always has a signature “tough and techy” MaRLo sort of sound.</p>

<p><em>Trance has evolved, significantly from its early days. Even if we compared the trance from just 10 years ago to what we hear now, they seem almost completely different. How/why do you think these changes came about? Major influences from other styles? Any trends going into the future?</em></p>

<p><strong>MaRLo:</strong> Yeah it’s changed a lot, but I think all styles of music have evolved and changed over the past 10 years… as people try to constantly push the boundaries and create something fresh. EDM is so competitive now, with so many great producers… and everyone wants to stand out from the crowd. I also think it’s great that all the different styles of music are “borrowing” ideas from other styles, I love diversity… keeps things interesting.</p>

<p>As for the trends of the future… I wish I knew that! let’s hope the next BIG thing is “Trechno” haha</p>

<p><em>House music has been seeing wider spread acceptance in mainstream music.  And although EDM as a whole is growing in popularity, trance still sometimes seems to be more “underground” – or at least not played on the “weekly radio” while the 4-to-the-floor 128BPM tunes from artists such as David Guetta are everywhere.  Have you seen signs of this changing?  We’ve asked how other styles influence trance, but how do you see trance influencing other styles?  There has been a definite increase in blending between electro house and trance, like for example Into You (Mikkas Remix) which uses the power of a trance build up with a electro house drop.  Do you see a trend in this?</em></p>

<p><strong>MaRLo:</strong> A lot of house, hip hop and pop tunes are using some of those big trance supersaw style sounds, so yes I do think that Trance has had a big influence on other styles, just like house and techno have had an influence on Trance… I think it’s a good thing.</p>

<p><em>So what makes up your collection of musical tools/instruments/weapons? What sort of DAWs and VSTs do you employ in production? Any particular hardware you love to use or anything you’re anxious to acquire? How does your setup differ in studio compared to a live show?</em></p>

<p><strong>MaRLo:</strong> I used to only use hardware synths (Roland JP8000, Nord Lead, Korg Wavestation, Novation Supernova 2 etc.) but I’m finding that I only really use the computer for my production now. Now I use Cubase, some nice Dynaudio speakers (BM5a) a decent soundcard and a whole bunch of vst’s. It doesn’t really matter what you use though, it’s the person that makes the tune sound good. When I used to do Live shows, it was all hardware (Drum machines, samplers, synths, vocalist etc.)</p>

<p><em>Our classic question: It’s 2 a.m. with a packed dance floor, what track do you drop to really make people reach for the sky?</em></p>

<p><strong>MaRLo:</strong> Well it totally depends on the party, but in the past the crowd always went pretty crazy whenever  I played my remix of Ferry Corsten’s Brain Box or also my remix of Key of Life… I think from now on though that my upcoming track featuring Jano called “The Island” and of course my remix of Ferry Corsten’s “Punk” – will probably get a dancefloor moving.</p>

<p><em>So where do you go from here? What releases should your fans be getting excited for? Any particular venues or festivals you’re anxious to play at?</em></p>

<p><strong>MaRLo:</strong> My next single “MaRLo ft Jano – The Island” I am very excited about it, it will have a professional video clip and I’m really happy with how the track turned out… it will be out at the end of May.</p>

        <p>We continue to trudge forward with new tracks from Ultra!  Although one can never be 100% sure the track you’re listening to isn’t one you just happened to have missed, I’m still pretty sure that what we have here are new tracks from Wolfgang upcoming album.  I’m further encouraged to say this since I recognized a few of them from his set in NY, but no where else.  And seeing as he directly confirmed with me that he had dropped 7 tracks from his new album in NY, I have a high degree of confidence we have some new stuff here.  Man, I cannot wait for that album, its going to ground-shaking, mark my words.</p>

<p>PS – Personally #3 is my favorite.  Or #1.  Or, ah, god I can’t choose, I love everything he does so much.</p>
